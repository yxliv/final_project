[["index.html", "Final Project: Analysis of Digital Advertising Chapter 1 Introduction", " Final Project: Analysis of Digital Advertising Yiqin Shi, Yuxuan Liang 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction The digital advertising start in the year 1994 when first online banner ad by AT&amp;T appeared on Hotwired magazine with a run time of three months for a price of $30,000. This ad produced click-through rates of 44%. Ever since, digital advertising became popular and advertisers have been through many upheavals and needed to adopt to constantly changing technological revolutions and consumer trends. In this project, we are intended to make a comparison among UK, US and China on their digital advertising in digital markets. We chose these countries because we believe they are the representative of European, American and Asian countries. Through this comparison, we would like to have a glimpse on the digital markets in three continents. We proposed three research questions and hope to find the answers through the data visualization process. How does the average ad spending different among markets? How does it divided between desktop and mobile in three countries? An analysis the ad spending in different countries and in different markets. Which market has the highest return on investment ratio? Compare the average ad spending per Internet user as well as the ad spending growth rate from 2017 to 2021 and the projected ones from 2022 to 2026 in different advertising markets in three countries, which segment will the market spending most in and why may be the reason behind? Focusing on social media advertising market, how does popular social network differ in three countries and how does social network users change from 2017 to 2026? In the next sections, we will present our process of answering those questions.

We download the tidy dataset using write.csv function and will use this version of dataset in our further analysis. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing Value Analysis: Figure 1 From Figure 1, we can see that users’ information(including Users by Income, Users by Gender, Users by Age, Usage Shares) is only available in 2021. This situation is reasonable because the original dataset is collected last year. The users’ information is inconstant and quickly changes over time, so it might be difficult to capture the previous users’ information and usage shares. In addition, the future data is also missing because there is only one-year data which couldn’t make any prediction about the future. For Top Company Revenues, as the original dataset was most recently updated in Nov 2021, statista hadn’t collected each company’s data for revenue which is usually published by the end of the year. Therefore, there is missing data from 2021 to 2026. We also notice that the data for Ad Spending share by industry is available only in 2020 and Ad Spending Growth including Desktop&amp;Mobile, by segment, (Non-)Programmatic, and Ad Spending Change are all missing in 2017 data. Figure 2 From Figure 2, we are able to tell that for each market, Ad Spending, Ad Spending Growth, and Average Ad Spending per Internet User do not have any missing value. Digital Market is the generic term for all five markets. As we can see from Figure 2, it contains all the aggregated variables without any missing value except for Ad Spending Share by Industry which we know is only available in 2020 from Figure 1. Missing values also exist in users’ information including Users by Income, Users by Gender, Users by Age, and Usage Shares, which are only available in 2021 as we know from Figure 1. For Top Company Revenues, we can see that only three markets(Search, Social, and Video) own the information of earnings, and it is missing for three markets because it is only provided until 2021. Some unique variables only exist in a specific market, so for rest of the others will not contain the rows for those variables. For Social Advertising, it includes Reach by social network variable which provides us with the number of users for different social media. For Classifields, it contains Ad Spending Share Desktop&amp;Mobile with percentage for each. For other markets, they are all included in Digital Advertising and have specific spending amounts for Desktop and Mobile. Those missing values are not essential for our further research. Therefore, we will not process them or delete any rows with missing data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results In this section, we will analysis the digital advertising market and provide our findings. 5.0.1 Research Question 1: Firstly, we look at the Average Ad spending and how it is divided into desktop and mobile. Since Classifieds(including General, Jobs, Motor, Real Estate) represents only a small portion of the overall Ad spending across all digital advertising marketplace, we only include the four major markets: Video, Banner, Social Media, and Search Advertising. We separately plot the donut charts for the past(2017-2021) and the future(predicted value for 2022-2026). For both of them, we calculated the average ad spending over 5 years and present it as the percentage in donut charts. Search and Banner Advertising market currently dominates the digital market; In terms of forecasts, Social Media and Video Advertising spending will increase and each four major markets will become more even across the whole digital market, while Search Advertising market remains the leading spender and Video Advertising market is the lowest. By the comparison between the donut chart of the past and the future, it is clear that the mobile section of Ad spending is increasing in all four markets. In particular, in Video Advertising, mobile will increase its share of AD spending by nearly 20%. Mobile AD spending in the banner and search AD markets will also increase by more than 10%. Social media advertising had the lowest growth rate, at about 5 percent, which makes sense given that mobile advertising already accounts for more than 80 percent of AD spending. The alluvial diagrams are also separately plotted by the timeline(the past and the future). The alluviums are colored by Desktop and Mobile. The difference between the alluvial diagrams and donut charts is that we can take a closer look at the change in the proportion of mobile and desktop sections in different countries. As we can see, the overall proportion of the mobile section will increase a lot from the past to the future. From countries’ sides, all three countries will increase their mobile AD spending in all four markets. More specifically, by seeing the change in width of alluviums of the mobile section, UK will increase its mobile Ad spending most in Video Advertising market; China will increase its mobile Ad spending most in Social Media Advertising market; US will increase its mobile Ad spending most in Video Advertising market. In conclusion, the weight of ad spending will gradually shift towards the mobile side, which is in line with our expectations. We believe that with the rapid development of mobile Internet, more and more Internet users can be exposed to mobile advertising, so mobile advertising will dominate digital advertising. 5.0.2 Research Question 2: Now, we will analysis the ad spending in different countries and in different markets. Firstly, we’d like to get a general idea of how much advertising is spent in different markets in the three countries. As you can see from the boxplots, overall Ad spending is increasing in all three countries, regardless of markets. However, the differences between the three countries vary in five markets. For Classifields, China has consistently been the highest spender of the three countries and will continue to grow at a faster rate than the US and UK in terms of projected value (2022-2026). In Search and Video Advertising market, the United States has been far ahead of the other two countries in terms of Ad spending, twice as much as the next largest country, China. In Social Media Advertising market, the US is also the leader, with China following at an even faster pace. In addition, The United Kingdom has consistently lagged far behind the other countries in five markets. We calculated the return on investment ratio (revenue divided by spending) based on available data on AD spending versus revenue(only available in Video, Social Media, and Search Advertising markets) from 2017 to 2020. Since returns are globally aggregated, we assume that these three countries account for 50% of worldwide revenue (the accuracy of this ratio does not affect the observation of change in return ratio). According to the heatmap, we find that the return ratio of Video and Social Media Advertising decreases year by year, and the rate of return of social media decreases faster given the more pronounced degree of color change for Social Media Advertising, while the return ratio of Search Advertising increases year by year. This finding is so interesting that we further take a closer look at advertising spending growth rate and spending per internet user for each market over the years. (If you move your mouse over the points in the plot, you will see the growth rate for each market in one year) China: The overall trend of Ad Spending per Internet User across all market is increasing by projection. Social Media Advertising has the largest projected growth rate, while search advertising does not have a large projected growth rate. Though, search advertising has the largest ad spending per internet user for now, it seems that market will focus on Social Media Advertising and Banner Advertising in the future. The overall trend for Ad spending growth across all markets is a year-over-year decline, with a plateau starting in 2023. Ultimately, Video and Social Media Advertising will have similar and higher growth rates than that of another three advertising markets, and the other three markets will have almost similar growth rates. In addition, we also notice that the ad spending growth Video, Classifields and Search Advertising have an obvious increase from 2020 to 2021, among which search advertising has the highest proportion of increase. ## # A tibble: 10 × 4 ## # Groups: Region [1] ## Region Year Market Average ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 United States 2017-2021 Banner Advertising 181. ## 2 United States 2022-2026 Banner Advertising 257. ## 3 United States 2017-2021 Classifieds 8.44 ## 4 United States 2022-2026 Classifieds 8.15 ## 5 United States 2017-2021 Search Advertising 205. ## 6 United States 2022-2026 Search Advertising 334. ## 7 United States 2017-2021 Social Media Advertising 135. ## 8 United States 2022-2026 Social Media Advertising 239. ## 9 United States 2017-2021 Video Advertising 102. ## 10 United States 2022-2026 Video Advertising 183. US: The overall trend of Ad Spending per Internet User across all market is increasing by projection except for Classified. Other Advertising has similar projected growth rate, but Banner Advertising has a smaller projected growth rate on Ad Spending. It is clear that US market is still focusing on Search Advertising. The overall trend for Ad spending growth across all markets is a year-over-year decline, with a flattening out starting in 2024. Finally, the growth rates of Video, Search, and Social Media Advertising are similar and higher than that of the other two, followed by Banner and then Classified, which will maintain the lowest growth rate. In addition, Video, Classifields and Search have an obvious increase from 2020 to 2021, among which search has the highest proportion of increase. ## # A tibble: 10 × 4 ## # Groups: Region [1] ## Region Year Market Average ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 United Kingdom 2017-2021 Banner Advertising 108. ## 2 United Kingdom 2022-2026 Banner Advertising 161. ## 3 United Kingdom 2017-2021 Classifieds 29.3 ## 4 United Kingdom 2022-2026 Classifieds 33.5 ## 5 United Kingdom 2017-2021 Search Advertising 157. ## 6 United Kingdom 2022-2026 Search Advertising 236. ## 7 United Kingdom 2017-2021 Social Media Advertising 92.4 ## 8 United Kingdom 2022-2026 Social Media Advertising 173. ## 9 United Kingdom 2017-2021 Video Advertising 56.5 ## 10 United Kingdom 2022-2026 Video Advertising 102. UK: The overall trend of Ad Spending per Internet User across all market is increasing by projection. Search and Social Media Advertising has larger projected growth rate. It is clear that UK market is still focusing on Search Advertising. The overall trend for Ad spending growth across all markets is a year-over-year decline, with a plateau starting in 2023. Finally, the growth rates of Video, Search, and Social Media Advertising are similar and higher than that of the other two, followed by Banner and then Classified, which will maintain the lowest growth rate. In addition, we also find that all markets have a significant increase from 2020 to 2021, among which search has the highest proportion of increase. Comparison between the above three line plots for each country: 1. All three countries experienced rapid declines in Ad spending growth for all markets in 2018-2020, followed by a rebound in some or all markets in 2021, with the UK showing the largest increase. 2. From the prediction of the future growth, growths in all five markets stabilize around 2023 for all three countries. Among them, Video, Search and Social Media Advertising in developed countries (the United Kingdom and the United States) are stable at 7-9%. However, only Video and Social Media Advertising maintain an increased rate of around 10% in China, a developing country. We speculate the reason behind it is that China has a large proportion of the population and advertising is still in the stage of development, so the growth rate could be higher. In addition, the low spending growth of Search Advertising might be due to the lack of a relatively perfect Search engine in China and the limitation of usage of Google in the country. 3. Based on the heatmap for the return ratio, the sharp and continuous declination of the return ratio for Social Media Advertising can possibly be a reason which explains the growth rate of social media advertising spending is decreasing year by year for all three countries except for the minimal increase from 2019 to 2021 in the UK. 4. Based on the heatmap for the return ratio, only the return ratio of Search Advertising kept increasing from 2017 to 2020. The increased return ratio might indicate the reason why Search Advertising has the highest increase in Ad spending growth in 2021 among all three countries. 5. Based on the slope graph, the US and the UK have a similar situation. They spend mostly on Search Advertising per Internet user, and then Social Media and Banner Advertising per Internet user. China, on the other hand, spends a lot on Social Media advertising and is decreasing its spending on Search Advertising per Internet user. 6. The US and the UK is expected to see the largest growth in Search Advertising spending per Internet user, which can be well proved by the consistently rise in return ratio for Search Advertising market. Still, China will increase most in the Social Media Advertising spending per Internet user instead of Search Advertising. The reasons behind it might be the low development and limitation of search engines as we mentioned before. We also understand that the return ratio is calculated using global advertising revenue, which might not well represent each country’s situation and we’d like to further explore the difference between China and other two countries in social media market. 5.0.3 Social Media Advertising As an interactive digital channel that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, and interests, social media had over 3.6 billion users in 2020 worldwide. Obviously, digital advertising will focus on social media market. China, US and UK have spent a total of 110,062.6 million USD on Social Media Advertising 2021 alone. And in those countries, this spending is continuously increasing. We first look at the demographics of social media. We could see a culture difference in it. In three countries, the largest part of users are in 25-34 years. However, in US and UK, smallest part of users are in 18-24 years, but in China, it is 55-64 years. Also, in China, there are more male users but in UK and US shows the opposite. When we check by Income levels, it is more interesting that China has more medium income users, US has more low income users, and UK has more high income users. html { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

The huge difference could be led by the population difference. “Total” in the above table is the sum of all social network users, which includes repeated calculation. Thus, we decide to use the distinct counting of total reach (from the dataset) and calculate the user ratio: \\(Average\\space Users = \\frac{\\sum_{year=2017}^{year=2026} Total\\space Users\\space }{10}\\) \\(User\\space Ratio = \\frac{Average\\space Users}{Population}\\) Region Average Users User Ratio China 1016.2646 0.706 US 295.7239 0.893 UK 59.801 0.881 Now it is clear that the US has the largest number of users and China have the least when taking population into account. From the Reach by Network table, the popular social media platforms vary from country to country. Especially in China, the top 5 social networks are different from those in the US and the UK. We believe that the reason behind this is the blockage of several social media in China. The only 2 social networks not banned in the US and the UK top 5 are LinkedIn and TikTok. The top 5 social networks in China are all Chinese companies. Another thing worth noting is that, though people in different countries are using different social media, the ratio of each social network user and total users are similar for the same ranking. For example, the ratio of the most popular social network is around 25% in the three countries. (If you move your mouse over the points in the plot, you will see the corresponding value) Now we will dig into each country. In China, the most frequent social network is WeChat from Tencent which is the only instant messaging app in the top 7. We can see that the growth rate of Wechat users is stable. Qzone, on the other hand, has a continuously negative growth rate. The users are decreasing since 2019 and are projected to be continuously decreasing in the future. Qzone is also the product of Tencent and is earlier than WeChat. Unlike WeChat, Qzone is a pure social networking platform where users could write blogs on it. However, this feature alone is not attractive enough to keep users. Another worth noting point is that LinkedIn is projected to have a dramatic decrease in users from 2021 to 2022. LinkedIn China announced that it would shut down the localized version of LinkedIn and launch a new InJobs App focusing on helping China-based professionals find jobs in China in 2021. And this announcement and action lead to a dramatic decrease in users. The UK and the US have a similar situation on the social network. Facebook has the most users and keeps a stable growth rate. Pinterest, though ranking six in both countries, has a decreasing growth rate in the the US but a stable growth rate in the UK. Twitter has had a very unstable growth rate in recent years in the US. But the data provider Statista has a positive view of Twitter’s user growth rate in the future. The user growth rate of Tumblr is worth noting. Similar to Qzone in China, Tumblr faced a massive drop in users from 2018 to 2019 and continues to drop till now in both countries. In December of 2018, Tumblr announced a new ban on “adult content”, and this action resulted in a dramatic drop in users. Conclusion Billions of people around the world use social media to share information and make connections, and thus the social media advertising market is becoming stronger. The Social Network market in China is very different from the US and the UK. And it might lead to the reason why China is spending mostly on social media advertising but the US and the UK are not. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Main takeaways of our exploration: Search and Banner Advertising Market are currently the majority of digital advertising spending; It is predicted that the investment in Social Media Advertising will increase, surpassing Banner, and the lowest advertising spending in Video will also increase. Eventually, except for Video Advertising, the proportion of the remaining three major markets will become relatively balanced, while Search Advertising market will always be in the leading position. Whether we look at the overall change of mobile advertising spending in each market or the adjustment of mobile advertising investment in each country, we can see the general increasing trend in the development of mobile advertising, which will account for over 3/4 of the total market. In terms of return ratio, the Video and Social Media Advertising have declined year over year, while Search Advertising have increased year over year. With the rapid update of technology and the continuous development of digital advertising, from the beginning of the rise of digital advertising, the high growth rate of advertising gradually declined from 2017 with a brief rally in 2021, and finally the growth rate of all advertising markets will be stable year by year according to the forecast. The US and UK are expected to see the largest increase in Ad Spending per Internet user in Search Advertising, while China is expected to see the largest increase in Ad Spending per user in the Social Media market. In terms of demographics, the UK and the US are similar. The age distribution of Internet users in the United States and the United Kingdom is relatively even, while the proportion of older Internet users in the 55-64 age range in China is significantly lower than in the other two countries. Meanwhile, the proportion of male users in China is larger than that of the other two countries. By income levels, the users’ distribution are relatively average across all three countries, but more specifically, China has more medium income users; US has more low income users; and UK has more high income users. The components of social media network in the US and the UK are very different from China. Due to the blockage of some social media popular in the UK and the US, China has more unique and different social media platforms. Nevertheless, the ratio of each social network user over total users are similar for different countries. US has the largest ratio of average users over 10 years and China have the least when taking population into account. Limitations: The top company revenues are globally collected, so we are not able to access the revenues for each country and calculate the return ratio for each country, which can help us better understand the difference between countries in advertising spending on five markets. The information contained in the dataset provided by Statista is not enough to provide us with very strong evidence that China chooses to spend more money on Social Media Advertising. Some of the data may not be accurate. For example, Wechat is a national social media platform in China, just like mobile phone SMS.. There are more than 1.1 billion monthly active users in China, accounting for more than 75% of the total population, while the data of Statista shows only about 25%, which makes us doubt the accuracy and rate of coverage of the data. Future direction: In the future, more research objects can be selected to systematically compare the differences in advertising spending and revenues between developed and developing countries, or to study the differences between European, North American and Asian countries. Rather than collecting data from single source, we will collect data from multiple sources to have a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of digital advertising markets. Lessons learned: By this project of discovering the advertising on digital market in three countries over 10 years, we have a better sense of how to access the research question from different perspectives and by different statistical graphics. In this project, we utilized time series line plots, grouped bar charts, heatmaps, donut charts, alluvial diagrams, and slope plots (some of them also incorporate with interactive designs.) to explore the topics from different dimensions and we learnt how to present the dataset more effectively by appropriately drawing those plots. In the process of drawing graphs, we become more familiar with how to filter and process datasets by using shortcuts of dplyr to achieve the data format required by the charts.
