# Introduction

The digital advertising start in the year 1994 when first online banner ad by AT&T appeared on Hotwired magazine with a run time of three months for a price of $30,000. This ad produced click-through rates of 44%. Ever since, digital advertising became popular and advertisers have been through many upheavals and needed to adopt to constantly changing technological revolutions and consumer trends.

In this project, we are intended to make a comparison among UK, US and China on their digital advertising in digital markets. We chose these countries because we believe they are the representative of European, American and Asian countries. Through this comparison, we would like to have a glimpse on the digital markets in three continents.

We proposed three research questions and hope to find the answers through the data visualization process.

1. How does the proportion of different advertising market in the three countries differ from 2017-2026? How does the present data and projected data differ in three countries? How does users age, gender, income affect the proportion? 

2. Compare the average ad spending per Internet user from 2017 to 2021 and the projected average ad spending per Internet user from 2022 to 2026 in different advertising markets in three countries, which segment will the market spending most in and why may be the reason behind?

3. Focusing on social media advertising market, how does popular social network differ in three countries and how does social network users change from 2017 to 2026?

In the next sections, we will present our process of answering those questions.

# Data sources

We collected our data from **Statista**, a German company specializing in market and consumer data. The specific dataset is from its digital market outlook - digital advertising section.

The link is provided here:
[link](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/worldwide)

We selected United States, United Kingdom and China as our observation units and respectively downloaded the dataset.

Datasets are present as following:
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
china.orginal <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_china_en_2022-03-03_18-16-31.csv")
us.original <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_united states_en_2022-03-03_18-15-03.csv")
uk.original <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_united kingdom_en_2022-03-03_18-10-30.csv")
head(china.orginal)
head(us.original)
head(us.original)
```

Each dataset has 16 columns: Region, Market, Chart, Name, Unit, Source and Years (2017-2026). The first five columns are filled with character data, and Years columns are filled with values which are all numeric data.

##### Region
It is a column filled with region. Each dataset has one region, so it does not help much when we research in one country. But it will be helpful when we combine datasets to do the comparison. 

##### Market
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
unique(china.orginal$Market)
```
There are six factors inside this column, but we only have five markets inside "Digital Advertising": "Banner", "Social Media", "Search", "Classifieds", and "Video". 

##### Chart
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
unique(china.orginal$Chart)
```
This column contains different charts we would use for further analysis. Mainly, we would look at Ad Spending, Users, and Reach by Social Network charts.

##### Name
This column contains different Names of Charts. We will not present them here because the dataset has not been transformed to tidy version.

##### Unit, Source, Year
Those columns are obvious, so we will not talk about them in detail here.

***

Briefly, we noticed that this dataset is not in tidy format and have several NAs. We will clean the dataset in the next sections.

<!--chapter:end:02-data.Rmd-->

```{r include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE
)
```
# Data transformation

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
china.orginal <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_china_en_2022-03-03_18-16-31.csv")
us.original <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_united states_en_2022-03-03_18-15-03.csv")
uk.original <- read_csv("dmo_digital-advertising_usd_united kingdom_en_2022-03-03_18-10-30.csv")
```

Since the datasets are not in the tidy version, we need to transform it.
Basically, we use the *pivot_longer* function to transform the multiple Years column to a single column.

The tidy datasets are presented below:
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
us <- us.original %>% select(-c("Source"))
china <- china.orginal %>% select(-c("Source"))
uk <- uk.original %>% select(-c("Source"))

us <- us %>% pivot_longer(col=!c(Region, Market, Chart, Name, Unit), names_to="Year", values_to="Value")
china <- china%>%pivot_longer(col=!c(Region, Market, Chart, Name, Unit), names_to="Year", values_to="Value")
uk <- uk%>%pivot_longer(col=!c(Region, Market, Chart, Name, Unit), names_to="Year", values_to="Value")

head(china)
head(us)
head(uk)
```

We download the tidy dataset using *write.csv* function and will use this version of dataset in our further analysis.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
write.csv(china, file = "china.csv")
write.csv(uk, file = "uk.csv")
write.csv(us, file = "us.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
china <- read_csv("china.csv") %>% select(c(2:8))
uk <- read_csv("uk.csv") %>% select(c(2:8))
us <- read_csv("us.csv") %>% select(c(2:8))
```

In this Section, we will dig into the Social Media Advertising. As an interactive digital channel that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, and interests, social media had over 3.6 billion users in 2020 worldwide. Obviously, digital advertising will focus on social media market. China, US and UK have spent a total of 110062.6 million USD on Social Media Advertising 2021 alone. And in those countries, this spending is continuously increasing. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
china.users <- china %>% filter(Market == "Social Media Advertising", Chart %in% c("Users by Age", "Users by Gender", "Users by Income"), Year == 2021) %>% select(1,3,4,7)

us.users <- us %>% filter(Market == "Social Media Advertising", Chart %in% c("Users by Age", "Users by Gender", "Users by Income"), Year == 2021) %>% select(1,3,4,7)

uk.users <- uk %>% filter(Market == "Social Media Advertising", Chart %in% c("Users by Age", "Users by Gender", "Users by Income"), Year == 2021) %>% select(1,3,4,7)

users <- rbind(china.users, us.users, uk.users) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Region, values_from = Value)
```

We first look at the demographics of social media. We could see a culture difference in it. In three countries, the largest part of users are in 25-34 years. However, in US and UK, smallest part of users are in 18-24 years, but in China, it is 55-64 years. Also, in China, there are more male users but in UK and US shows the opposite. When we check by Income levels, it is more interesting that China has more medium income users, US has more low income users, and UK has more high income users.
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
users %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Demographics**"),
    subtitle = "unit in %"
  ) %>%
  cols_align(
  align ="left",
  columns = c(1,2)
) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_borders(
        sides = c("bottom"),
        color = "black",
        weight = px(1)
      ),
      cell_borders(
        sides = c("bottom"),
        color = "black",
        weight = px(1)
      )),
    locations = list(
      cells_body(
        columns = 1:5,
        rows = 5
      ),
      cells_body(
        columns = 1:5,
        rows = 7
      )
    )
    )

```


Next, we take a brief look at the Ad spending in Social Media market by Year and Country. Clearly, three countries increase their spending year by year. Compared to US and China, UK spend relatively smaller amoun of money in Ad spending in Social Media Market. 
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
ad.spending <- rbind(china,us,uk) %>% filter(Market == "Social Media Advertising", Chart == "Ad Spending", Name == "Total") %>% select(1,6,7)
nPlot(Value ~ Year, 
            group = 'Region', 
            data = ad.spending, 
            type = 'multiBarChart'
)
```


In order to understand the benefits of Social Media Advertising, it is important to understand the mechanics of social media networks. We decide to look into the social network reach in China, US and UK. Social network reach refers to the number of users who have come across a particular content on a social platform.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
china.reach <- china %>% 
  filter(Chart == "Reach by social network") %>% 
  select(1,4,6,7) %>% 
  filter(Name != "Total")

china.reach.avg <- china.reach %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  summarize(`Average Users` = mean(Value)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Average Users`)) %>% 
  mutate(perc = `Average Users`/sum(`Average Users`)) %>% 
  add_row(Name = "Total", 
          `Average Users` = sum(.$`Average Users`), 
          perc = sum(.$perc), 
          .before = 1) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = percent(perc, accuracy = 0.001)) %>% 
  select(-3)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
us.reach <- us %>% 
  filter(Chart == "Reach by social network") %>% 
  select(1,4,6,7) %>% 
  filter(Name != "Total")

us.reach.avg <- us.reach %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  summarize(`Average Users` = mean(Value)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Average Users`)) %>%
  mutate(perc = `Average Users`/sum(`Average Users`)) %>% 
  add_row(Name = "Total", 
          `Average Users` = sum(.$`Average Users`), 
          perc = sum(.$perc), 
          .before = 1) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = percent(perc, accuracy = 0.001)) %>% 
  select(-3) %>% 
  add_row(Name = c(NA,NA,NA), 
          `Average Users` = c(NA,NA,NA))
```


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
uk.reach <- uk %>% 
  filter(Chart == "Reach by social network") %>% 
  select(1,4,6,7) %>% 
  filter(Name != "Total")

uk.reach.avg <- uk.reach %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  summarize(`Average Users` = mean(Value)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Average Users`)) %>% 
  mutate(perc = `Average Users`/sum(`Average Users`)) %>% 
  add_row(Name = "Total", 
          `Average Users` = sum(.$`Average Users`), 
          perc = sum(.$perc), 
          .before = 1) %>% 
  mutate(Percentage = percent(perc, accuracy = 0.001)) %>% 
  select(-3) %>% 
  add_row(Name = c(NA,NA,NA,NA), 
          `Average Users` = c(NA,NA,NA,NA))
```


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
reach.avg <- cbind(china.reach.avg, us.reach.avg, uk.reach.avg)
colnames(reach.avg) <- c("Social Network in China", "Average Users in China","Percentage in China", "Social Network in US", "Average Users in US","Percentage in US","Social Network in UK", "Average Users in UK","Percentage in UK")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
my_theme <- function(data) {
  tab_options(
    data = data,
    heading.align = "middle",
    heading.title.font.size = 20,
    table.border.top.color = "black",
    column_labels.border.bottom.color = "black",
    column_labels.border.bottom.width= px(2),
    column_labels.font.size = 18
  )
}


reach.avg %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "China", columns = 1:3) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "US", columns = 4:6) %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "UK", columns = 7:9) %>%
  cols_label(
    `Social Network in China` = "Social Network",
    `Average Users in China` = "Average Users",
    `Percentage in China` = "Percentage",
    `Social Network in US` = "Social Network",
    `Average Users in US` = "Average Users",
    `Percentage in US` = "Percentage",
    `Social Network in UK` = "Social Network",
    `Average Users in UK` = "Average Users",
    `Percentage in UK` = "Percentage"
  ) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Reach By Network**"),
    subtitle = "unit in million users"
  ) %>%
tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "grey", alpha = 0.2),
      cell_borders(
        side = c("bottom"), 
        color = "black",
        weight = px(1)
        ),
      cell_text(style="italic")
      ),
    locations = cells_body(
      rows = 1
      )
  ) %>% 
  cols_align(
  align ="left",
  columns = everything()
) %>%
  my_theme()
```

From the table, we could see that China has the largest number social media users and Uk has the least. The huge difference could be led by the population difference. Since "Total" here is the sum of all social network users, there is repeated calculation. We decide to use the distinct counting of total reach (from the dataset) and calculate the ratio of average users and population.

|Region  |Average Users |Ratio
|:------ |:------       |:------
|China   |1016.2646     |0.706
|US      |295.7239      |0.893
|UK      |59.801        |0.881

Now it is clear that US has the largest number of users and China have the least when taking population into account.

From the Reach by Network table, the popular social media platforms varies from country to country. Especially in China, the top 5 social networks are totally different from those in US and UK. We believe that the reason behind is the blockage of several social medias in China. The only 2 social networks not banned in US and UK top 5 are LinkedIn and TikTok. The top 5 social networks in China are all Chinese companies.

Another thing worth noting is that, though people in different countries are using different social medias, the ratio of each social network users and total users are similar for the same ranking. For example, the ratio of most popular social network are around 25% in three countries.



```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
china.reach.avg.top7 <- china.reach.avg %>% 
  select(1,2) %>% 
  add_row(Name = "Other", 
          `Average Users` = sum(.$`Average Users`[9:19])) %>% 
  slice(-(9:19)) %>% 
  slice(-1)

china.reach.avg.top7 %>% 
  hchart(
    "treemap", 
    hcaes(x = Name, value = `Average Users`, color = `Average Users`)
    ) %>%
  hc_title(
    text = "Reach by Social Network in China (Top 7)",
    margin = 10,
    align = "left",
    style = list(color = "#6da9df", useHTML = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
china.reach.order <- china.reach %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>% 
  mutate(mean = mean(Value)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean), Year) %>% 
  select(-mean) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(Order = rep(c(1:18), each = 10))

df.china.reach.order <- china.reach.order %>% 
  dplyr::rename(`Social Network` = Name, 
                `Million Users (2017-2026)` = Value) %>% 
  group_by(`Social Network`, Order) %>% 
  summarize(`Million Users (2017-2026)` = list(`Million Users (2017-2026)`)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(Order) %>% 
  select(1,3)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
reactable(
  df.china.reach.order,
  columns = list(
    `Social Network` = colDef(maxWidth = 200),
    `Million Users (2017-2026)` = colDef(
      cell = react_sparkline(df.china.reach.order,height = 50,
        tooltip_type = 2,
        show_area = TRUE,
        decimals=2,
        statline = "mean",
        statline_color = "orange",
        statline_label_size = "0.5em")
    )
  )
)
```

Now we will dig into each country. In China, the most frequent social network is WeChat from Tencent and is the only instant messaging app in the top 7. We can see that the growth rate of Wechat users are stable. Qzone, on the other hand, has a continuously negative growth rate. The users are decreasing from 2019 and is projected to be continuously decreasing in the future. Qzone is also the product of Tencent and is earlier than WeChat. Unlike WeChat, Qzone is a pure social networking platform that users could write blogs on it. However, this feature alone is not attractive enough to keep users. Another worth noting point is that LinkedIn is projected to have a dramatic decrease of users from 2021 to 2022. LinkedIn China announced that it would shut down localized version of LinkedIn and launch a new InJobs App focusing on helping China-based professionals find jobs in China in 2021. And this announcement and action clearly lead to the dramatic decrease of users.

```

UK and US have similar situation on social network.Facebook has the most users and keeps a stable growth rate. Pinterest, though ranking six in both couuntry, has a decreasing growth rate in US but a stable growth rate in UK. Twitter has a very unstable growth rate in recent years in US. But the data provider Statista has a positive view on Twitter's user growth rate in the future. The user growth rate of Tumblr is worth noting. Similar to Qzone in China, Tumblr faced a massive drop of users from 2018 to 2019 and continuous to drop till now in both countries. In December of 2018, Tumblr announced a new ban on “adult content", and this action resulted to the dramatic drop of users.
